# RCWA-3D
MATLAB code to simulate the reflection, transmission and field distribution caused due to the diffraction of light from 3D metamaterial grating structures. find the stability boundaries of two co-existing pulse solutions of the cubic-quintic mode-locking equation.

The implementation of the RCWA is based on the following papers:
 - M. G. Moharam and T. K. Gaylord, “Rigorous coupled-wave analysis of planar-grating diffraction,” J. Opt. Soc. Am. 71, 811-818 (1995).
 - L. Li, “New formulation of the Fourier modal method for crossed surface-relief gratings,” J. Opt. Soc. Am. A 14, 2758-2767 (1997).
 - L. Li, “Formulation and comparison of two recursive matrix algorithms for modeling layered diffraction gratings,” J. Opt. Soc. Am. A 13(5), 1024-1035 (1996). 

In order to illustrate its use, we generate Figs. 2, 4, 8a, and 9c from the [paper](http://www.photonics.umbc.edu/publications/PdfPapers/PAJ285.pdf) below: <br>
